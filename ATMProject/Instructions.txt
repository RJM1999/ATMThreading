Instructions for our ATM Threading assignment

Upon launching the program a form appears with 2 buttons, Run the program with or without race conditions. If you run the program with race conditions a data race will occur when opening 2 terminals with the
same account number, otherwise no data race will occur. When running with a data race it is advised you open 2 ATMs with the same account number and then withdraw money on 1 ATM then it will wait until
you withdraw on the other ATM then Check the balance and there will be a inconsistency in the funds available in the account.

If without race conditions is ran another form appears for a semaphore test, if you run the program with this and you have logged into 2 ATMs with the same 
account number, one ATM will stop until an amount is withdrawn from the other ATM. You can then check the balance and the correct balance will appear. 

If you wish to run more than 2 ATMs with different account numbers please run: Run without race conditions -> Run without semaphore test and you can run as many as you wish.
